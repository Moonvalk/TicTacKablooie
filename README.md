# TicTacKablooie
A two-player best-of-five Tic Tac Toe game written in TypeScript.

This project was created over the course of a day and a half completely from scratch. This involved writing a small game engine that handles tracking game objects within a runtime update loop and rendering. I chose to utilize TypeScript, HTML5 Canvas, and some basic CSS to create the bulk of the project. The game itself features hotseat multiplayer gameplay, a main menu, custom graphics/UI, and more! I hope you have fun checking this out.

Please make sure to install all dependencies for the project as needed. Webpack is used to compile, package, and serve the build on a local test server.
